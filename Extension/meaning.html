    <h1>What does the trustworthiness percentage means?</h1>

    <div class="description">
        <p>This trustworthiness test evaluates how trusted a website is based on several factors. You should keep in
            mind that
            this test is just an indication, so if a website got a high score, that does not mean that the website is
            perfectly fine.
            On the other hand, if a website got a low score, that does not mean that the website is not trusted at all.
            This test just gives you an indication to help you
            make better decisions.</p>
